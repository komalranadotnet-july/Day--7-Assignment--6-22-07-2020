Q. Switch -Statement in javascript

Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax-

switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}

This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once.
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
If there is no match, the default code block is executed.


The break Keyword-

When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of inside the block.

It is not necessary to break the last case in a switch block. The block breaks (ends) there anyway.

The default Keyword-
The default keyword specifies the code to run if there is no case match
