Q. Do while loop in javascript

The do/while statement creates a loop that executes a block of code once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

The do/while statement is used when you want to run a loop at least one time, no matter what.

do {
  code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
